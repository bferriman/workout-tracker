[Deployed Site](https://benferriman.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This app allows the user to enter exercise data and group exercises together in workouts.  Exercise and workout data is visualized in graphs on the Dashboard page.

## Technologies Used

Data is stored with MongoDB and managed via Mongoose.  Back end uses Express.  Charts built with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Opportunities For Further Development

In a real world setting, I think it would be more useful for the charts to display the last X days, to show the user inactive days as well.  In the setting of a demo project, I decided that wouldn't work well as it would often show no data at all on initial load due to lack of use.

It would be cool to be able to create exercise goals and then have charts showing progress toward those goals.
